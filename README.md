# Virus_For_Fun
Simple virus using Python to annoy friends
A simple virus that I created with Python, whose mission is to open web pages and send notifications to the desktop with a random and unlimited number, which is classified as annoying

This virus aims to learn and have fun with friends, and we do not mean anything, and we are not responsible for anything that may harm the users
